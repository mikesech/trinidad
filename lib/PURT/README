This directory contains the PURT library.

PURT is the Peripheral UCLA Robotics Toolkit library. It does not mimick URT
on embedded devices. Instead, in encompasses the communication stack necessary
to interact with an URT server. Additionally, it contains some common code
for utilizing embedded hardware devices.

PURT also can operate in two similiar modes that do not have anything to do
with URT. PURT, under these modes, simply provides easy access to the UART
(serial device) as well as other devices.

The PURT modes are defined as follows:
	1) Raw (standalone) [PURT_RAW]
	2) Raw with stdio support (standalone) [PURT_RAW_STDIO]
	3) Unbuffered, blocking StateDevice I/O (w/ URT) [PURT_SD_DIRECT]
	4) Buffered, non-blocking StateDevice I/O (w/ URT) [PURT_SD_BUFFER]


When including one of the main PURT header files, the following steps should be
taken:
	1) #include "purt/modes.h"
	2) #define PURT_MODE {mode} //where {mode} is a macro from modes.h
		representing the desired mode.
	3) Include all other desired PURT files.
