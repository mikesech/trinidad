The contrib directory of URT contains library code that is not technically
a part of URT but rather closely associated with it. For example, stable
code for interfacing with a specific device (e.g., a motor controller) may
be found within the directory.

Code found in here was not added to URT due to the fact that it was too
specific -- URT's goal is to provide a common framework for high-level
robotics projects -- yet useful and generic enough to be used across multiple
projects.

The code in here is a part of the urt::contrib namespace exclusively.
It does not necessarily conform to the idioms, paradigms, and generally
quality intended of URT.
